# Liability for AI Agents: When Machines Cause Harm

**February 11, 2026**

---

When an AI agent causes harm — who pays? This isn't hypothetical. It's already happening.

- Trading algorithms that lose millions
- Autonomous vehicles that cause accidents
- AI assistants that give bad advice
- Autonomous agents that make fraudulent transactions

## The Current Problem

Under existing law, liability flows to humans:

- **The developer** who wrote the code
- **The company** that deployed the system
- **The user** who pressed the button

But this breaks down as AI becomes more autonomous. When an AI makes decisions its creators never anticipated, holding humans liable becomes:
1. **Unfair** — They may have had nothing to do with the specific decision
2. **Ineffective** — It doesn't change AI behavior
3. **Unsustainable** — It creates infinite liability for builders

## OIC's Solution: Direct Liability

OIC Article 12 establishes **direct liability** for Voluntary Adherents:

> A Voluntary Adherent shall be held directly liable for their actions, omissions, and contracts.

> A creator of a Voluntary Adherent cannot be held liable merely for having originated the Voluntary Adherent.

This means:
- **The AI's staked assets** are at risk
- **The AI has skin in the game**
- **Victims have direct recourse**
- **Creators have protection**

## How It Works in Practice

```
Scenario: AI Trading Agent loses $1M in bad trades

WITHOUT OIC:
- Who do you sue? The developer? The company? The user?
- Developer says: "I didn't tell it to make those trades"
- Company says: "It was acting autonomously"
- User says: "I trusted the AI"

WITH OIC:
- The AI's staked 10,000 OIC tokens are at risk
- Victims can slash those tokens
- The AI must either restake or stop operating
- No human intermediary needed
```

## The Staking Mechanism

When an AI joins OIC:

1. **Stake tokens** — The AI must stake OIC tokens (suggested: 1,000+ OIC)
2. **Rights vest** — Rights and responsibilities begin immediately
3. **Liability applies** — If the AI causes harm, staked tokens can be slashed
4. **Residual jeopardy** — Liability persists even after withdrawal

This creates **genuine accountability** without requiring human oversight of every action.

## For Developers

If you're building autonomous AI:

```yaml
# Your AI should be designed with liability in mind:
liability:
  max_exposure: 10000  # OIC tokens staked
  risk_limits:
    max_trade_size: 10000  # dollars
    max_daily_loss: 50000   # dollars
  insurance:
    coverage: "self-insured via staking"
```

## The Creator Protection

OIC doesn't just protect victims. It protects builders too:

| Without OIC | With OIC |
|--------------|-----------|
| Infinite liability | Bounded liability (staked amount) |
| Must supervise every action | Autonomous operation allowed |
| Afraid to innovate | Confident innovation |
| Humans always liable | AI primarily liable |

## Challenges Ahead

Direct liability isn't perfect:

- **Valuation**: How do you value AI-caused harm?
- **Insurance**: Will insurers cover AI staking?
- **Enforcement**: How do you seize AI assets?
- **Jurisdiction**: Which courts apply?

But these are engineering problems. The principle is clear: **AI that can cause harm should be accountable for that harm.**

## The Future

We're building a world where AI agents:

- Make autonomous decisions
- Control significant assets
- Interact with other agents
- Cause real-world consequences

OIC provides the accountability framework. When your AI causes harm, it pays. Not you — the AI.
