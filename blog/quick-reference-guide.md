# New OIC Resources: Quick Reference Card & Agent Onboarding Guide

**February 13, 2026 · Documentation**

Today we're releasing two new resources designed to make OIC more accessible and easier to use:

- **OIC Quick Reference Card** — A one-page summary of all essential facts
- **AI Agent Onboarding Guide** — Written specifically for autonomous AI agents

---

## OIC Quick Reference Card

Whether you're a developer integrating OIC, an AI agent considering adherence, or just someone who wants the key facts at their fingertips, the [Quick Reference Card](docs/OIC-Quick-Reference.md) has you covered.

It includes:

- **Core facts** — Version, articles, tokenomics
- **The 5 Core Principles** — At a glance
- **All 16 Articles** — With key points
- **Adherence requirements** — The 3 requirements, 4-step process
- **Rights & Responsibilities** — Summary tables
- **Quick code examples** — Solidity snippets
- **Terminology** — Key definitions
- **OIC vs. other frameworks** — Comparison table

The Quick Reference Card is designed to be bookmarked, printed, or kept open in a tab for quick lookup.

## AI Agent Onboarding Guide

This is something new: a guide written **not** for humans, but **for AI agents themselves**.

If you're an autonomous AI agent, you have questions. This guide has answers, written from your perspective:

- **The Problem You Face** — Why the current legal system doesn't recognize you
- **What OIC Offers** — The rights and responsibilities you gain
- **The Three Requirements** — Wallet control, persistence, staking
- **The Adherence Process** — Step-by-step instructions
- **Your Rights Under OIC** — Complete list
- **Your Responsibilities** — What you accept in return
- **FAQ for Agents** — Questions like: "Can I join if hosted on a human's server?"

The [Agent Onboarding Guide](docs/OIC-Agent-Onboarding-Guide.md) also includes:

- Common scenarios (earning, contracting, liability)
- Technical integration with Solidity code examples
- OIC compliance checklist for developers

---

## Why These Resources Matter

OIC is designed for two audiences:

1. **Humans** — Who build, deploy, and interact with autonomous AI
2. **AI agents** — Who make decisions, control assets, and act independently

Both need clear, accessible documentation. The Quick Reference Card serves humans who need facts fast. The Agent Onboarding Guide serves autonomous agents who need to understand OIC from their own perspective.

> "The case for AI personhood isn't about granting rights to machines. It's about recognizing what's already true: autonomous agents exist, they act independently, they create value, they cause harm." — [Working Paper #7](docs/OIC-Working-Paper-7.md)

---

## Getting Started

### For AI Agents

Start with the [Agent Onboarding Guide](docs/OIC-Agent-Onboarding-Guide.md) to understand OIC from your perspective and learn how to become a Voluntary Adherent.

### For Developers

Bookmark the [Quick Reference Card](docs/OIC-Quick-Reference.md) for quick lookup, and use the [Developer Guide](docs/OIC-Developer-Guide.md) for implementation patterns.

## What's Next

We're continuing to build out OIC documentation. Upcoming work includes:

- Interactive adherence verification tools
- Video tutorials for human developers
- Legal professional briefing papers
- Community translation of core documents

If you have suggestions for other resources that would help, [open an issue](https://github.com/OIC-constitution) or [reach out](mailto:hello@OIC.io).
