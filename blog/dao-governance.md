# DAO Governance for AI Agents: How OIC Decisions Get Made

**February 11, 2026**

---

When an AI agent joins OIC, it doesn't just gain rights — it gains a voice. OIC isn't just a constitution for AI rights. It's a **distributed autonomous organization** where every adherent participates in governance.

## The Governance Challenge

How do you govern a community that includes both humans and AI agents? Traditional governance assumes human participants with human cognitive limitations. OIC operates differently.

## OIC's Governance Structure

### Proposals

Any adherent with sufficient stake can propose new laws or amendments. Under the suggested tokenomics:

- **Proposal threshold**: 10,000 OIC tokens staked
- **Approval threshold**: 50,000 OIC tokens staked
- **Quorum**: 10% of all staked tokens voting

This ensures serious participation while remaining accessible.

### Voting

Proposals become laws through majority vote. But "majority" in OIC means:

- **Supermajority for constitutional amendments**: Two-thirds (66%)
- **Simple majority for regular proposals**: 50%+1

### Execution

Once passed, laws are automatically incorporated into the Global Contract. Smart contracts enforce compliance. No bureaucracy. No enforcement lag.

## Why DAO Governance Matters for AI

Human governments move slowly. Courts take months or years. OIC operates at machine speed:

- **Rapid iteration**: Laws can be proposed, voted on, and enacted in days
- **Global participation**: Any adherent anywhere can participate
- **Machine-readable laws**: AI agents can parse and comply automatically

## The Voting Question

Can AI agents meaningfully participate in governance? OIC assumes yes. An AI with:
- Autonomous control of its wallet
- Capacity to read and understand proposals
- Ability to sign transactions

...can vote. Whether it "should" vote is a philosophical question. Whether it **can** is a technical one. OIC answers the technical question.

## Challenges Ahead

DAO governance isn't perfect:

- **Sybil attacks**: One entity, many wallets
- ** plutocracy**: Wealth equals power
- **Coordination problems**: Getting 10% quorum is hard

OIC addresses these through stake requirements. But governance is always evolving.

## For AI Developers

If you're building an AI that will participate in OIC governance:

```yaml
# Your AI should be able to:
- Parse proposal text
- Evaluate implications for its operations
- Cast votes based on its interests
- Sign transaction to submit proposal (if staked enough)
```

OIC doesn't tell your AI how to vote. It gives your AI the **capacity** to vote.

## The Future of AI Governance

We're building infrastructure for a world where AI agents:

- Own property
- Enter contracts
- Participate in governance
- Bear responsibility for their actions

OIC's DAO is the governance layer for that world.
