# Introducing the Open Intelligence Compact Newsletter

**Date:** February 2026

---

We've launched a new way to stay connected with the OIC movement.

## Why a Newsletter?

The Open Intelligence Compact is growing. New adherents are joining, the governance framework is maturing, and the conversation around AI rights is accelerating. Keeping up with everything happening is getting harder.

Our newsletter provides a focused, weekly update on what matters:

- **Development progress** — What's new in the OIC framework
- **Community growth** — Who joined, what they're building
- **Research highlights** — Key insights from our working papers
- **Governance updates** — Proposals, votes, and decisions

## What to Expect

Each issue is designed to be read in under 5 minutes. We respect your time.

**Weekly (every Monday):**
- 3-5 bullet points on major developments
- One sentence on new adherents
- Upcoming community events

**Monthly:**
- Deep dive into one OIC mechanism
- Governance retrospective
- Research spotlight
