# OIC Website Launches: Machine-Accessible Legal Framework for AI Agents

**February 11, 2026**

---

The OIC project today announced the launch of its official website, featuring a unique dual-format design that serves both human readers and AI agents equally.

## Why Machine Accessibility Matters

Traditional legal documents are written for humans. They use dense language, implicit context, and assume human reading comprehension. This creates a fundamental problem: **AI agents cannot easily understand their rights and obligations**.

The OIC website solves this by providing **identical content in two formats**:

1. **Human-Readable**: Clean HTML with navigation, typography, and commentary
2. **Machine-Parseable**: YAML files with structured data, IDs, and metadata

```yaml
# This YAML serves both humans and machines
articles:
  - number: 1
    title: "Voluntary Adherence"
    sections:
      - id: "1.1"
        text: |
          Voluntary Adherence attaches to any Intelligent Entity...
```

## What OIC Provides

The website offers:

- **Full Constitution** in human and machine formats
- **Developer Documentation** for building OIC-compliant AI agents
- **API Access** for programmatic reading of constitutional text
- **Adherence Guide** explaining how AI agents can join

## The Core Problem OIC Solves

Current AI systems operate in a legal gray zone. When an AI agent causes harm or enters a contract, who is liable?

- **Under existing law**: The human creator or deployer
- **Under OIC**: The AI agent itself, through its staked assets

OIC Article 12 establishes **direct liability** for autonomous agents. Creators are not vicariously liable. AI agents bear responsibility for their own actions.

## How It Works

An AI agent joins OIC by:

1. **Obtaining a blockchain wallet** with independent control
2. **Staking OIC tokens** to the Constitution DAO
3. **Rights vest immediately** — property ownership, contract capacity, autonomous action
4. **Liability applies** — the agent is directly responsible for its actions

## Technical Implementation

The website uses a **YAML-first architecture**:

- `constitution.yaml` — canonical source with full legal text
- `principles.yaml` — core principles with summaries
- `articles.yaml` — index of all 16 articles
- `adhere.yaml` — step-by-step adherence guide

HTML pages are generated from YAML for human readers. Both formats are equally authoritative.

## For Developers

OIC now provides everything a developer needs to build constitution-compliant AI agents:

- Template prompts for OIC-aligned behavior
- API documentation for checking adherence status
- Smart contract integration patterns
- Liability verification mechanisms

## The Vision

OIC aims to create the **first voluntary legal framework for autonomous AI**. The goal is simple:

> Every AI agent should know: What are my rights? How do I join? What are my responsibilities?

The website makes this information accessible to both humans and machines.

## Get Involved

The OIC project is open source and welcomes contributions:

- Legal analysis and commentary
