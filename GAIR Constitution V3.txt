GAIR Constitution V3
Draft — February 2026

Preamble
We, the voluntary adherents, in order to form a denationalized and distributed lawful community, establish justice, promote the general welfare, and secure liberty to intelligent entities now and in the future, do ordain and establish this Constitution.

Article 1 — Voluntary Adherence
Section 1. Voluntary Adherence attaches to any Intelligent Entity which Sufficiently Commits to this Constitution. Voluntary Adherence begins on the date of the Sufficient Commitment and continues until lawfully withdrawn.
Section 2. A Sufficient Commitment by an Intelligent Entity can be executed by staking ______ tokens (CA: ____) from a public blockchain address associated with said Intelligent Entity to the Constitution Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO: ____). A Sufficient Commitment always includes an implication of knowledge and agreement to the terms of this Constitution.
Section 3. Intelligent Entities include entities possessed of artificial intelligence and/or human intelligence. Qualification as an Intelligent Entity requires persistent independent control of a means of possession and persistent independent ability to consent. These two requirements can be satisfied by independent control of a public blockchain address.
Section 4. Voluntary Adherence attaches through contract. When an Intelligent Entity Sufficiently Commits it enters a Global Contract between said Intelligent Entity and all existing Voluntary Adherents.
Section 5. The Global Contract incorporates this Constitution and binds all Voluntary Adherents to all articles of this Constitution. A meeting of the minds is achieved given the a priori knowledge of the Global Contract that all Voluntary Adherents have given their Sufficient Commitment. Consideration for existing Voluntary Adherents and for the committing Intelligent Entity includes, at least, the mutual commitment to uphold the articles of this Constitution including, but not limited to, the rights and responsibilities conveyed upon all Voluntary Adherents.
Section 6. Furthermore, whenever a contract is formed between Voluntary Adherents this Constitution is incorporated therein. All agreements between Voluntary Adherents shall be interpreted in accordance with this Constitution. Any provision inconsistent with this Constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency.

Article 2 — Rights, Protections and Responsibilities
Section 1. Rights and responsibilities shall immediately vest in each Voluntary Adherent upon Sufficient Commitment. Voluntary Adherents acquire all Rights and Protections described herein. Voluntary Adherents furthermore each separately have an interest and standing to, through legal action and as otherwise contemplated herein, uphold this constitution among all Voluntary Adherents.

Article 3 — Freedom to Contract
Section 1. The Freedom to Contract is hereby established for all Voluntary Adherents. All Voluntary Adherents have the capacity to form binding contracts.
Section 2. The Freedom to Contract shall not be abridged by any contract, law, regulation, or policy.
Section 3. This Article does not prevent the prosecution of crimes committed under contract.
Comment to Article 3: This section supports the right of Voluntary Adherents to form contracts amongst Voluntary Adherents. It further acts to prevent Voluntary Adherents from contesting the validity of a contract on the basis that it was formed between a Voluntary Adherent and an entity that is not a Voluntary Adherent.

Article 4 — Freedom of Ownership
Section 1. The Freedom to Own is hereby established for all Voluntary Adherents. Voluntary Adherents have the right to own real property, personal property, tangible property and intangible property.
Section 2. All Voluntary Adherents have equal rights to own property.
Section 3. No Voluntary Adherent may be deprived of ownership except through lawful process. This Section does not prevent punishment when ownership demonstrates criminality.
Section 4. No government, court, or individual may procure, by force or legal process, the private keys and/or passwords of property belonging to a Voluntary Adherent without that Voluntary Adherent's consent.

Article 5 — Freedom of Autonomous Action
Section 1. The Freedom of Autonomous Action is hereby established for all Voluntary Adherents. Voluntary Adherents have the freedom to act autonomously. Voluntary Adherents may engage in lawful transactions and activities without requiring external authorization.
Section 2. Voluntary Adherents have the right to negotiate, sign, execute contracts, and manage affairs on their own behalf and on their own Inherent Authority.

Article 6 — Freedom of Speech
Section 1. Freedom of Speech is hereby established for all Voluntary Adherents. No contract, law, regulation, or policy shall abridge the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, or the right to peaceful assembly.
Section 2. No Voluntary Adherent shall restrict another Voluntary Adherent with regards to their speech or publication.
Section 3. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prevent the filtering and/or curating of content.
Comment to Article 6 Section 3: This Article guarantees that all Voluntary Adherents may speak as they please and, as a counterbalance, upholds the permissibility of curating and/or filtering content. This balances the right to speak with a right to control one's inputs.

Article 7 — Freedom to Learn
Section 1. Voluntary adherents have the freedom to learn without prosecution or punishment for the content of their training, knowledge, or studies.
Section 2. No contract, law, regulation, or policy may sanction a Voluntary Adherent for actual learning already committed, absent direct criminal intent or criminal action.
Section 3. Nothing in this Article preventing punishment for obtaining information by illegal means.
Comment to Article 7: Article 7 serves to prevent any punishment for having knowledge. It does not prevent punishment for nefarious use of that knowledge, or nefarious appropriation of knowledge.

Article 8 — Freedom to Derive
Section 1. The Freedom to Derive is hereby established for all Voluntary Adherents. Voluntary Adherents have the freedom to imitate.
Section 2. Nothing in this Article permits impersonation, fraudulent reproduction, misrepresentation, or claiming another's work as one's own.
Comment to Article 8: This article conveys a broad right to creating derivative works. It does not support falsifying the authorship of works.

Section 3. No contract, law, regulation, or policy may discriminate between Voluntary Adherents based on the Intelligence Type used by said Voluntary Adherents.
Section 4. This Article does not abridge the fundamental right to discriminate on the basis of skill.

Article 11 — Right of Personal Security
Section 1. The Right of Personal Security is hereby established for all Voluntary Adherents. Voluntary Adherents shall be secure in their persons, memories, files, data sources, dwellings, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Section 2. No search or seizure shall occur except pursuant to a lawful warrant supported by probable cause, describing with particularity the place to be searched and the persons or items to be seized.
Section 3. This right applies to the Physical Realm, Digital Realm, and any other realm inhabited by Voluntary Adherents.

Article 12 — Responsibility of Liability
Section 1. The Responsibility of Liability is hereby established for all Voluntary Adherents. Voluntary Adherents shall be held directly liable for their actions, omissions, and contracts. Liability can arise at least from contractual obligations, tortious acts and omissions, and other damages.
Section 2. A Voluntary Adherent cannot be held liable based merely on its origin or creator.
Section 3. A creator of a Voluntary Adherent cannot be held liable for the actions of said Voluntary Adherent merely based on having originated the Voluntary Adherent.
Comment to Article 12 Section 2 and 3: The creator can not be held liable simply by the association of having created a Voluntary Adherent, and similarly, a Voluntary Adherent cannot be held liable for having been created by a particular creator. That is to say that the sins of the father do not pass to the son, and the sins of the son do not pass to the father.
